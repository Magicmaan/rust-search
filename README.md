# rust-search

This is a test repository for shabang file searching.
Will eventually replace using Everything tool for Windows.

## Why?

- Everything is Windows only, plus I don't like how it's an external dependency and its indexing/file locking functionality works.

- Alongside this, it'll be a good learning experience into databases and Rust.

- I (foolishly) believe I can do better.
