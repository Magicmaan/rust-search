# rust-search

This is a test repository for shabang file searching.
Will eventually replace using Everything tool for Windows.

## Why?

Everything is windows only, plus i don't like how its an external dependency and its indexing / file locking functionality works. Alongside this, it'll be a good learning experience into databases, and rust.
I (foolishly) believe I can do better.
